## Contents:

- Replication material for the simulations of the article are contained in the folder 'simulations'. For this, first run the script in 'main_simulation_BashLoop.sh' (on a small cluster in parallel if possible) that repeatedly runs the simulations contained in the file 'sim_BashLoop.R'. The file 'sim_eval_RR.R' produces the evaluation plots shown in the paper.
- Replication material for the applications of the article is given in the folder 'application'. For the application, the necessary data files are not included in the repository as they cannot be made publicly available and require 28GB of storage space. Based on the data, the file 'prepare_ticks.R' prepares the data for processing and the loop in the file 'main_application_BashLoop.sh' calls the files 'resample_stocks_RR.R' and 'application_RVest_RR.R' for each stock. These files compute the resampled returns and the respective RV estimators respectively. The resampling techniques at a 5 second frequency are computationally heavy and should be run on a cluster with sufficient memory. The file 'application_eval_RR.R' produces the tables and plots for the estimation application of the paper. The results for the forecasting application are generated by calling the file 'application_HAR_forecasting.R'.
